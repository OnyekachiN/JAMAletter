# JAMAletter
This project set out to observe the distributions of p-values derived from top medical literatures within a certain time frame.
Of additional interest was the observation of p-value bias and the over inflated importance of p-values.

Data for this project was sourced from abstracts of 3 major epidemiology journals, APE, JAMA and Lancet by means of web scrapping (using R programing language) and manual review. Abstracts retrieved where from the period of 2000 to 2010.

P-values, effect estimates such as hazard and odds ratios with the addition of confidence intervals (CI) and sample size if available were retrieved from the abstracts.

**/upload/Data**

This folder contains raw data utilized for this project.
This includes two files, an edited file with our criteria’s/columns of interest and an original unedited file which has all the criteria’s.

**/Code**

Folder contains code used for the scrapping of p-values and other criteria’s of interest. Original code depicting the extraction of p-values from abstracts was sourced from the Jager and Leek paper titled *“An estimate of the science-wise false discovery rate and application to the top medical literature"* and can be found using the link https://github.com/jtleek/swfdr/blob/master/getPvalues.R.
