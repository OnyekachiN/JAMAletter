# JAMAletter
This project set out to observe the distributions of p-values derived from top medical literatures within a certain time frame.
Of additional interest was the observation of p-value bias and the over inflated importance of p-values.
Data for this project was sourced from  abstracts of 3 major epidemiology journals, APE, JAMA and Lancet by means of web scrapping (using R programing language) and manual review. Abstracts retrieved where from the period of 2000 to 2010.
P-values, effect estimates such as hazard and odds ratio's with the addition of confidence intervals (CI) and sample size if available were retieved from the abstracts.
Raw data ustilized for this project can be found in the JAMAletter/upload directory. This includes two files, including an edited file with our criterias/columns of interest and an original unedited file which has all the criterias.
Code implemented for carrying out this task was sourced and built upon from leek code (dont know real name yet) and can be found in the JAMAletter/code directory.  
Below are tables and figures of the results derived from this project. Figure 1a and 1b illustrates (get picture details from jordan) and table 1 highlights (get table information from Jordan).
